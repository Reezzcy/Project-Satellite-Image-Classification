# Satellite Image Detection Project

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a satellite image classification system using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that has been processed with Gaussian Blur technique for noise reduction and LBP (Local Binary Pattern) for image segmentation. Satellite image classification has many important applications, including environmental monitoring, remote sensing, and regional mapping. Using image processing techniques such as Gaussian Blur and LBP is expected to improve the quality of extracted features and classification accuracy.

## Objective
- Development of an automated classification system for satellite imagery.
- Improved accuracy in classifying objects or features in satellite images.
- Further utilisation in environmental monitoring, regional mapping, and other applications that require satellite image analysis.

## Tools
- Tensorflow
- Scikit-Image
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
